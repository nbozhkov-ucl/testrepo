"<p></p><h4>Providing feedback on your assessed work </h4><p>Feedback concerning your work is an extremely important part of your 
academic development at UCL, and the Department is committed to 
providing appropriate support. We&nbsp;<span lang=""ES"">aim to ensure that the
 assessment mechanisms allow students to demonstrate the skills and 
knowledge they have gained and that the assessments are carried out 
fairly and consistently. It is a priority of the Department to provide 
students with suitably instructive and timely feedback.&nbsp; Late submission
 penalties are given in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.12"">Academic Manual Section 3.12</a></span></p><h4><span>Turnaround time</span></h4><p><p>The Department aims to return assessed work within <b>20</b> working days of the submission deadline date. The feedback turnaround times are monitored by the Departmental Teaching Committee,
 and&nbsp; we expect students to have had the opportunity to reflect, and 
act, on their learning from the feedback in subsequent assessments.</p></p><p></p>"
