<h3>Providing feedback on your assessed work</h3>↵<p>Feedback concerning your work is an extremely important part of your academic development at UCL, and the Department is committed to providing appropriate support. We <span lang="ES">aim to ensure that the assessment mechanisms allow students to demonstrate the skills and knowledge they have gained and that the assessments are carried out fairly and consistently. It is a priority of the Department to provide students with suitably instructive and timely feedback.  Late submission penalties are given in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.12">Academic Manual Section 3.12</a></span></p>↵<h3><span>Turnaround time</span></h3>↵<p>The Department aims to return assessed work within <b>20</b> working days of the submission deadline date. The feedback turnaround times are monitored by the <span><span>Departmental Teaching Committee</span>,</span> and  we expect students to have had the opportunity to reflect, and act, on their learning from the feedback in subsequent assessments.</p>↵<p></p>
